# About-me

I am a software development student with interest for backend web development. I study at Instituto Tecnologico de Las Am√©ricas (ITLA) in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic since January 2023.

I know technologies like Typescript, HTML, CSS and VueJS and ReactJS for frontend. But my main ecosystem is .NET, focusing in a special way to the backend development with C#, ASP.NET Core and the .NET ecosystem.
